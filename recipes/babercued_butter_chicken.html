    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or about 1 teaspoon per pound of chicken</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Direction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add water, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, poultry seasoning, onion powder, cayenne pepper, and butter to a saucepan. Place over medium heat until butter is halfway melted; turn off heat, and whisk until butter disappears. Let marinade cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut chicken into halves or quarters and place in a resealable plastic bag. Whisk cooled marinade thoroughly and pour into the bag. Squeeze out air and seal tightly.</li>
        <li>Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours and up to overnight, turning the bag occasionally. (At this point, chicken is ready to be roasted or grilled. What follows are instructions for partially baking chicken, then finishing on the grill.)</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place chicken pieces, skin side up, in a baking dish; pour in all of the marinade.</li>
